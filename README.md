# AI Interview Training Platform

A full-stack interview coaching application for teams that hire through structured, repeatable interviews. Candidates practice against a curated question bank. Coaches review session transcripts and AI-generated feedback reports. Admins track readiness across cohorts.

This project is a portfolio demonstration — built with Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase-style data modeling, and a provider-agnostic AI layer that defaults to deterministic mock responses for safe local review.

## Who this is for

**Hiring teams and HR leaders.** If your organization runs structured interviews and wants to reduce variance between interviewers, this shows the kind of tooling you can build.

**Engineering teams evaluating an agency partner.** It demonstrates production patterns — type safety, quality gates, schema design, provider boundaries, and CI — without requiring cloud credentials to run.

**AI agents and technical screeners.** It passes install, lint, typecheck, test, and build in a single CI workflow. It separates concerns between data, AI providers, and presentation. It uses deterministic mock providers so review is reproducible.

## What you're looking at

The demo models a product management interview practice loop:

*Above: the main dashboard showing an active practice loop — candidate Maya Rivera working through a PM behavioral screen with coach Ava Patel. Mock AI follow-up questions appear in the transcript panel. The rubric scores update automatically from transcript analysis.*

Below are the key sections. Click through the screenshot set in `docs/screenshots/` to see each one full-size.

| Screenshot | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `01-dashboard-hero.png` | Landing view with active practice loop, candidate/coach assignment, and current score |
| `02-candidate-workspace-session-builder.png` | Three candidates across two roles, each with a readiness score and progress bar. Session builder panel shows coach-selected questions from the question bank |
| `03-transcript-follow-up.png` | Full transcript between coach, candidate, and AI. The mock AI generates a follow-up question that targets the candidate's weakest signal |
| `04-feedback-rubric-report.png` | Rubric scores across Communication, Role Depth, Structure, and Coachability. Each score includes evidence extracted from the transcript. A recommended practice loop is generated at the bottom |
| `05-admin-analytics.png` | Admin dashboard with candidate counts, completion metrics, average scores, role coverage, and a candidate progress timeline |

## Project story

This application was built to demonstrate end-to-end ownership of an AI-powered SaaS product. The brief was straightforward: can a candidate practice an interview, receive structured feedback, and give a coach enough signal to decide whether they're ready for a real loop — all from a single application?

The answer is yes. A candidate logs in (role-gated in production via Supabase Auth). A coach builds a session from a question bank, selecting questions by role, difficulty, and rubric focus. The candidate answers. An AI layer — swappable between mock, OpenAI, and Anthropic — generates follow-up questions and a scored feedback report. An admin dashboard tracks readiness across the cohort.

The AI provider boundary is the critical architectural decision. By default, the app uses a deterministic mock that scores from transcript signal (metric evidence, trade-off language, ownership framing). The mock is testable, reproducible, and safe for portfolio review. Swapping to a live provider is a configuration change — the mock remains the test harness.

## Quick start

You don't need any API keys, cloud accounts, or databases to run this.

```bash
npm install
npm run seed:demo
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

All data is fictional. All AI responses are deterministic mocks. Nothing calls an external service.

## Quality gates

Every push runs through:

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript
npm test            # Vitest — 4 test files covering mock AI, rubric reports, admin analytics, and progress timelines
npm run build       # Production build
```

CI is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs on every push and pull request.

Tests verify:
- Mock AI follow-up generation targets the right question focus
- Rubric scores reflect transcript signal (metrics, trade-offs, structure)
- Admin analytics correctly aggregate across candidates and sessions
- Candidate progress timelines sort by date

## Tech choices

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js App Router | Server components, file-based routing, and the standard for React SaaS products in 2025–2026 |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety across the data layer, provider boundary, and UI |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, zero-runtime, and the design system ships as CSS — no component library lock-in |
| AI layer | Provider-agnostic adapter (mock / OpenAI / Anthropic) | Swap providers without touching UI or data logic. Mock provider makes testing deterministic |
| Data model | Supabase-style SQL with RLS policies | Schema design that maps directly to a production Supabase project. Mock data runs standalone |
| Testing | Vitest | Fast, Jest-compatible, first-class TypeScript support |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Standard for GitHub-hosted projects |

## Architecture at a glance

```
src/app/page.tsx          ← Presentation: dashboard, transcript, rubrics, analytics
  → src/lib/demo-data.ts  ← Fixture data: candidates, coaches, questions, sessions, transcripts
  → src/lib/providers/    ← AI provider boundary (mock default, OpenAI/Anthropic optional)
  → src/lib/analytics.ts  ← Admin summaries and progress timelines
```

```
supabase/
  → migrations/           ← Schema: profiles, candidates, sessions, transcript turns, rubric scores, feedback reports
  → seed.sql              ← Demo-ready SQL seed data
```

The architecture doc at `docs/architecture.md` covers provider boundaries, RLS policies, and the human-in-the-loop gate in detail.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` if you want to customize. The defaults work out of the box:

```
AI_PROVIDER=mock
```

Mock mode requires no provider keys. The OpenAI and Anthropic adapters are boundary stubs — they exist to show the provider-swapping pattern and fail closed without real keys.

## Supabase schema

The migration under `supabase/migrations/` models:

- **Profiles** with candidate, coach, and admin roles  
- **Candidate-coach assignments**  
- **Question bank** with role focus, difficulty, tags, and rubric coverage  
- **Interview sessions** with selected questions and follow-up modes  
- **Transcript turns** distinguished by speaker (coach, candidate, AI)  
- **Rubric scores** per category with evidence extracted from the transcript  
- **Feedback reports** with strengths, risks, and recommended practice

Row-level security policies are documented inline: candidates see their own sessions, assigned coaches see their candidates, and admins see operational analytics.

The demo runs entirely from local fixtures — no Supabase project required. The schema and RLS policies are there to show production data-modeling thinking.

## Demo data

All data is fictional and public-safe:

- 3 candidates across Product Manager and Full Stack Engineer roles  
- 2 coach/admin users  
- 4 question bank items covering behavioral, strategy, architecture, and coachability  
- 5 interview sessions (4 completed, 1 scheduled)  
- A transcript between coach Ava Patel and candidate Maya Rivera with mock AI follow-up  
- A generated feedback report with rubric scores

Refresh the demo seed:

```bash
npm run seed:demo
```

This writes `.generated/demo-seed.json`. The `.generated/` directory is git-ignored.

## Production roadmap

What a production version would add:

- Supabase Auth with role-based access  
- Coach approval workflow before AI-generated feedback reaches candidates  
- Live provider prompt templates with evaluation fixtures and cost controls  
- Per-tenant workspaces for enterprise training cohorts  
- Audit logs for report edits and coach overrides  
- Playwright end-to-end screenshot tests

## Safety

- No real API keys, secrets, tokens, or credentials are committed  
- All people, emails, companies, and metrics are fictional  
- `AI_PROVIDER=mock` is the default and the only provider that ships wired  
- No outbound network calls are made in default configuration  
- See `docs/public-safety.md` for the publication checklist

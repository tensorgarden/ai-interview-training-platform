# Architecture

This document covers the structural decisions behind the AI Interview Training Platform — how data flows, how the AI provider boundary works, and how the system would operate in production.

## Request flow

```
Browser
  → Next.js App Router (src/app/page.tsx)
    → src/lib/demo-data.ts        (fixture data: candidates, sessions, transcripts)
    → src/lib/providers/index.ts   (AI provider selector)
      → mock.ts                    (deterministic, default, tested)
      → openai.ts                  (stub, fails closed without key)
      → anthropic.ts               (stub, fails closed without key)
    → src/lib/analytics.ts         (admin summaries and progress timelines)
```

The page component is an async server component. It loads fixture data, calls the configured AI provider for follow-up questions and feedback reports, and passes everything to the client component tree. There is no client-side data fetching in this demo — everything renders server-side from local data.

## AI provider boundary

The `src/lib/providers/` directory enforces a single interface: `InterviewAiProvider`. Every provider implements `generateFollowUp` and `generateFeedbackReport`.

The selector in `index.ts` reads `AI_PROVIDER` from the environment and instantiates the matching adapter. The default is `mock`.

**Mock provider (default):**
- Deterministic. Same transcript always produces the same follow-up questions and rubric scores.
- Used by all Vitest tests.
- Scores are derived from simple transcript signal analysis: metric evidence, trade-off language, ownership framing, and STAR-like structure.

**OpenAI and Anthropic stubs:**
- Exist to show the provider-swapping pattern.
- Both fail closed — they check for API keys and throw if missing. Neither is wired to a live model.
- In production, the application would add prompt templates and streaming response handling to these files while keeping the mock provider as the test harness.

## Data model

The Supabase migration in `supabase/migrations/` defines:

```
profiles
  ├── role: candidate | coach | admin

candidates
  ├── profile_id → profiles
  ├── coach_id → profiles
  ├── target_role, cohort, readiness_score

question_bank
  ├── role_focus, difficulty, tags, rubric_focus

interview_sessions
  ├── candidate_id, coach_id
  ├── selected_question_ids
  ├── follow_up_mode: mock_ai | manual
  ├── status: scheduled | in_progress | completed
  ├── final_score

transcript_turns
  ├── session_id → interview_sessions
  ├── speaker: coach | candidate | ai
  ├── text, timestamp, question_id

rubric_scores
  ├── session_id → interview_sessions
  ├── category, score, max_score, evidence

feedback_reports
  ├── session_id → interview_sessions
  ├── overall_score, summary, strengths, risks, recommended_practice
```

### Row-level security (RLS)

The migration includes RLS policies as schema documentation:

| Policy | Scope |
|---|---|
| Candidates read own sessions and reports | `candidate_id = auth.uid()` |
| Coaches read their assigned candidates | `coach_id = auth.uid()` |
| Admins read all operational data | `is_admin()` check on profiles |

These policies are documented in the migration SQL but not enforced in the local demo, which runs from fixture data without Supabase Auth.

## Human-in-the-loop gate

The mock AI generates follow-up questions and draft feedback reports. The UI positions coaches as reviewers — not as bypassed operators. This is intentional.

In production:
- AI-generated feedback should require coach approval before a candidate can see it.
- Coaches can override rubric scores with their own judgment.
- Every coach edit should be audited.

The demo shows the coach review surface inline. The approval workflow is noted as a production roadmap item.

## Where real Supabase would plug in

Currently, all data is served from `src/lib/demo-data.ts` — static TypeScript arrays. To wire a real Supabase backend:

1. Add Supabase Auth to the Next.js app.
2. Replace demo-data.ts with Supabase client queries.
3. Enable RLS and test that policies reject unauthorized reads.
4. The session-builder and analytics components don't change — they consume the same TypeScript interfaces.

The schema migration and RLS policies are already written. The data layer is deliberately thin so swapping from fixtures to a database is a focused change, not a rewrite.

## Testing strategy

Tests live alongside source files:

```
src/lib/__tests__/
  └── mock.test.ts        ← mock AI follow-up generation
  └── analytics.test.ts   ← admin analytics and progress timelines
```

All tests use Vitest and the mock provider. No tests require network access, real API keys, or a running Supabase instance.

The `npm test` command runs all test files. CI runs `npm test` after lint and typecheck and before the production build.
